# Day 1

## Part 1

I was going to do C originally but I figure I should save that for a future day, same as with python. I picked awk because it was a language made for linewise text processing so it can't be that bad.

Let's hope part 2 doesn't make me regret it!

It didn't go that well because I couldn't figure out how to index the string but hey this works.

## Part 2
Doesn't seem that difficult. Some gsubs will fix this right up.

Wait no this is evil oml. OH MY GOD IT'S EVEN MORE EVIL.

Can't substr...

My biggest struggle was how weird the interface is for processing characters inside a line. It worked out though..
